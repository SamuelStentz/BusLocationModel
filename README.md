We will discuss what our input features will be in meeting. 

Before we begin I would like everyone to clone the repository below:

Steps for cloning a repository:
  1) open command prompt
  2) path to the directory you want to be in
  3) git clone url

Voila! Let me know if something goes wrong. Let me be clear this is not my repository but I wanted to give you guys a quick rundown
scikit so you can use it for this project (potentially) or future projects

Now look at the readme there for applications you will need to follow along
